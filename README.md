3. **Winning**:
   - The team with the highest total runs wins the game.
   - In case of a tie, the match is declared a draw.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for game implementation.
- **NumPy**: Library for array operations and random number generation.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and displaying team information.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment used for code development and documentation.
